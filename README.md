# Spam Email Detection Using Count Vectorizer and Comparative Analysis of Multiple Classifiers

Explore my Kaggle notebook that uses Multinomail Na√Øve Bayes classifier for spam email detection [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/reddybharat/spam-email-detection).

This project focuses on identifying spam emails using a combination of text processing and machine learning techniques. The process begins with transforming the text data using a Count Vectorizer, which converts the email content into a matrix of token counts. Once the text data is vectorized, multiple classifiers are applied and compared to evaluate their performance in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails. These classifiers may include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines, among others.
